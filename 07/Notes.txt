Module: Sizes and Units

- For fixed elements, the % value for width and height is in relation to the containing block.
So if the element is fixed, the cont. block is the viewport. 100% for the width of the element will be occupy
the total width of the viewport.

-> Fixed element: CBlock: Viewport

- For absolute elements, the % value for the props will be the content + padding of the relative ancestor.
The CBlock for the absolute element, is the closest ancestor with a non-static position.

-> Absolute element: CBlock: closest ancestor with non-static position

- For static/relative elements, the % value for dimensions references to the closest ancestor
that is a container block.

->Static/Relative element: CBlock: closest block ancestor

- It can be good to use a dynamic unit like rem in text-size, margin and padding to keep proportions.
  We need to consider what is the default value in the browser (in absolute px units)

- margin: auto is a way of center the content of a block element
